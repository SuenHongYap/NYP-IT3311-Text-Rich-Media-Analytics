# Background

Videos are often classified and tagged with certain video categories to be used by recommender systems and listed when a user searches videos related to a certain category. Thumbnails and video title are usually the first thing that come to usersâ€™ eyes, and they are usually very related to the content of the video so that users would click on that video.

The goal of this assignment is to build a solution to automatically classify videos based on the thumbnails and video title through machine learning techniques.
