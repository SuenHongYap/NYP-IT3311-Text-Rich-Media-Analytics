# Background

Videos are often classified and tagged with certain video categories to be used by recommender systems and listed when a user searches videos related to a certain category. Thumbnails and video title are usually the first thing that come to usersâ€™ eyes, and they are usually very related to the content of the video so that users would click on that video.

The goal of this assignment is to build a solution to automatically classify videos based on the thumbnails and video title through machine learning techniques.

# Video Category Classification
You are required to determine the category of a video given its title, transcript, and thumbnail.

You have been tasked to build:
1. A text classification model to classify the video category based on its title and transcript.
2. An image classification model to classify the video category based on its thumbnail. This analysis aims to be accompaniment to the results of the text classification.

# Task 1: Text Classification (20 marks)

You are required to build a text classification model to predict the video category based on its title and transcript.

Complete the following tasks:
1. Data Understanding: Examine the dataset
2. Data Preparation: Prepares the data and all necessary preprocessing tasks
3. Modelling: Use different text representation and algorithms
4. Evaluation: Evaluates results from the algorithms and select the best model

# Task 2: Image Classification (20 marks)

You are required to build an image classification model to predict the video category based its thumbnail. This analysis aims to be accompaniment to the results of the text classification and the possibilities of using the image classification results together for video category classification.

Complete the following tasks:
1. Data Understanding: Examine the dataset
2. Data Preparation: Prepares the data and all necessary preprocessing tasks
3. Modelling: Use different image representation and algorithms
4. Evaluation: Evaluates results from the algorithms and select the best model
